# Classification of Cars Using Multiple Linear Regression

## Overview
This project implements a classification system for predicting car types using Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) based on features such as price, year, and engine capacity. Developed in Python using scikit-learn, this project explores the relationships between variables to predict car categories.

## Key Features
1. Data Collection:
* Collecting a comprehensive dataset of car features including price, year of manufacture, and engine capacity.
* Preprocessing data to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and normalize numerical features.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
* Analyzing the dataset to understand the distribution of features and their relationships.
* Visualizing correlations between features using heatmaps and pair plots.

3. Feature Engineering:
* Creating new features that might improve the predictive power of the model.
* Selecting the most relevant features for the MLR model.

4. Model Development:
* Implementing Multiple Linear Regression using scikit-learn.
* Training the model on the dataset and tuning hyperparameters for optimal performance.

5. Model Evaluation:
* Evaluating the model's performance using metrics such as R-squared, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
* Performing cross-validation to ensure the model's robustness.

6. Visualization:
* Visualizing the results of the model, including predicted vs. actual car types.
* Plotting residuals to diagnose model performance.

## Objectives
1. Predict Car Types: Use Multiple Linear Regression to predict car categories based on features like price, year, and engine capacity.
2. Understand Relationships: Explore and understand the relationships between different car features and their impact on car type classification.
3. Model Evaluation: Assess the performance of the MLR model and ensure its reliability in predicting car types.

## Insights
1. Feature Impact: Identified key features that significantly impact car type prediction, such as engine capacity and price.
2. Model Performance: Demonstrated that MLR can be an effective method for predicting car categories, though it may have limitations with non-linear relationships.
3. Data Quality: Highlighted the importance of high-quality, well-preprocessed data for improving model accuracy and reliability.
4. Practical Applications: Showcased the practical application of MLR in the automotive industry for tasks such as market segmentation and inventory management.
